## Week 5, Wednesday 3/April [Henry]
- This project needs more work to meet the pass hurdle.
- Include multi-line comments (/* */) before each function, to outline what the function does, any arguments and return types, and how to use it.

## Week 6, Monday 8/April [Henry]
- I still see no code, only 3 files (zip, changelog, readme)
- Given the requirement for at least 2 work days per week, at this point you are unlikely to pass. So if you are going to withdraw from the unit, please do so quickly.
